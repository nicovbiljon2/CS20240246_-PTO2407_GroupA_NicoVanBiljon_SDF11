# Learning Reflections

Within this portfolio piece project I had the opportunity to apply what I have learned so far in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
As I was working on this project I could see that I still got a lot the learn. Implementing different approaches, making mistakes and rectify them, I finally completed this project.

What I learned during this project is:

- To always have a mobile first approach when creating the layout of a webpage.
- Correctly setting up the structure of containers for the content in HTML.
- By getting this correct the implementation of flexbox and grid becomes easier and to position the content on the web page.
- Better understanding on how to implement flexbox, grid layouts especially for small, medium and large screens.
- Styling the webpage using CSS Tailwind.

This project was great introduction into the world of web development.
